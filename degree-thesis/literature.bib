abstract = {Malware detection is one of the most important tasks in cybersecurity. Recently, increasing interest in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Machine Learning algorithms, which are widely used in image analysis and predictive modelling, led to their use in static malware classification and to the application of these powerful tools in computer industry and industrial internet of things. Many studies claim that the static malware detection approach, under well-defined conditions, can deliver fast and accurate malware classification results with relatively little human effort once the framework is implemented, relying solely on the binary content of the file. This becomes evident if we compare static malware detection to other techniques of dynamic nature. The focus of our research is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of CNNs used for static malware detection, starting from images obtained from byte-wise conversion of binary executable files to pixel images to critically analyze the assumptions underlying the performance of this type of technique.}

	Abstract = {This comprehensive survey deliberated over the security of electronic payment systems. In our research, we focused on either dominant systems or new attempts and innovations to improve the level of security of the electronic payment systems. This survey consists of the Card-present (CP) transactions and a review of its dominant system i.e. EMV including several researches at Cambridge university to designate variant types of attacks against this standard which demonstrates lack of a secure "offline" authentication method that is one of the main purpose of using the smart cards instead of magnetic stripe cards which are not able to participate in authentication process, the evaluation of the EMV migration from RSA cryptosystem to ECC based cryptosystem 3. The evaluation of the Card-not-present transactions approaches including 3D Secure, 3D SET, SET/EMV and EMV/CAP, the impact of concept of Tokenization and the role of Blind Signatures schemes in electronic cash and E-payment systems, use of quantum key distribution (QKD) in electronic payment systems to achieve unconditional security rather than only computational assurance of the security level by using traditional cryptography, the evaluation of Near Field Communication (NFC) and the contactless payment systems such as Google wallet, Android Pay and Apple Pay, the assessment of the electronic currency and peer to peer payment systems such as Bitcoin. The criterion of our survey for the measurement and the judgment about the quality of the security in electronic payment systems was this quote: "The security of a system is only as strong as its weakest link"},

@inproceedings{bond_chip_2014,
	Abstract = {EMV, also known as "Chip and PIN", is the leading system for card payments worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS) terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered two serious problems: a widespread implementation flaw and a deeper, more difficult to fix flaw with the EMV protocol itself. The first flaw is that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this nonce. This exposes them to a "pre-play" attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to clone a card physically. Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. The second problem was exposed by the above work. Independent of the random number quality, there is a protocol failure: the actual random number generated by the terminal can simply be replaced by one the attacker used earlier when capturing an authentication code from the card. This variant of the pre-play attack may be carried out by malware in an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled these flaws to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, and monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures. More than a year after our initial responsible disclosure of these flaws to the banks, action has only been taken to mitigate the first of them, while we have seen a likely case of the second in the wild, and the spread of ATM and POS malware is making it ever more of a threat.},

@inproceedings{zhou_nshield_2014,
	Abstract = {The Near Field Communication ({NFC}) technology is gaining increasing popularity among mobile users. However, as a relatively new and developing technology, {NFC} may also introduce security threats that make mobile devices vulnerable to various malicious attacks. This work presents the first system study on the feasibility of and defense again passive {NFC} eavesdropping. Our experiments show that commodity {NFC}-enabled mobile devices can be eavesdropped from up to 240 cm away, which is at least an order of magnitude of the intended {NFC} communication distance. This finding challenges the general perception that {NFC} is largely immune to eavesdropping because of its short working range. We then present the design of a hardware security system called {nShield}. With a small form factor, {nShield} can be attached to the back of mobile devices to attenuate the signal strength against passive eavesdropping. At the same time, the absorbed {RF} energy is scavenged by {nShield} for its perpetual operation. {nShield} intelligently determines the right attenuation level that is just enough to sustain reliable data communication. We implement a prototype of {nShield}, and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments. Our results show that {nShield} has low power consumption (23 {uW}), can harvest significant amount of power (55 {mW}), and adaptively attenuates the signal strength of {NFC} in a variety of realistic settings, while only introducing insignificant delay (up to 2.2 s).},

Several recent techniques in detecting fraud are constantly evolved and applied to many commerce areas. The goal of this paper is to propose a new taxonomy and a comprehensive review of different types of fraud and data mining techniques of fraud detection. The novelty of this paper is collecting all types of frauds that can detect by data mining techniques and review some real time approaches that have capability to detect frauds in real time.},

abstract = {The explosive growth and increasing sophistication of Android malware call for new defensive techniques to protect mobile users against novel threats. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose and develop an intelligent system named Dr.Droid to jointly model malware propagation and evolution for their detection at the first attempt. In Dr.Droid, we first exploit higher-level semantic and social relations within the ecosystem (e.g., app-market, app-developer, market-developer relations etc.) to characterize app propagation patterns; and then we present a structured heterogeneous graph to model the complex relations among different types of entities. To capture malware evolution, we further consider the temporal dependence and introduce a heterogeneous temporal graph to jointly model malware propagation and evolution by considering heterogeneous spatial dependencies with temporal dimensions. Afterwards, we propose a novel heterogeneous temporal graph transformer framework (denoted as HTGT) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving the heterogeneity to learn node representations for malware detection. Specifically, in our proposed HTGT, to preserve the heterogeneity, we devise a heterogeneous spatial transformer to derive heterogeneous attentions over each node and edge to learn dedicated representations for different types of entities and relations; to model temporal dependencies, we design a temporal transformer into the HTGT to attentively aggregate its historical sequences of a given node (e.g., app); the two transformers work in an iterative manner for representation learning. Promising experimental results based on the large-scale sample collections from anti-malware industry demonstrate the performance of Dr.Droid, by comparison with state-of-the-art baselines and popular mobile security products.},

abstract = {There has been a recent surge of interest in automating software engineering tasks using deep learning. This article addresses the problem of code generation, in which the goal is to generate target code given source code in a different language or a natural language description. Most state-of-the-art deep learning models for code generation use training strategies primarily designed for natural language. However, understanding and generating code requires a more rigorous comprehension of the code syntax and semantics. With this motivation, we develop an encoder-decoder Transformer model in which both the encoder and decoder are explicitly trained to recognize the syntax and dataflow in the source and target codes, respectively. We not only make the encoder structure aware by leveraging the source code’s syntax tree and dataflow graph, but we also support the decoder in preserving the syntax and dataflow of the target code by introducing two novel auxiliary tasks: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) path prediction and dataflow prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a structure-aware Transformer decoder that models both syntax and dataflow to enhance the quality of generated code. The proposed StructCoder model achieves state-of-the-art performance on code translation and text-to-code generation tasks in the CodeXGLUE benchmark and improves over baselines of similar size on the APPS code generation benchmark. Our code is publicly available at .},

abstract = {The security of smart contract has always been one of the significant problems in blockchain. As shown in previous studies, vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to unpredictable losses. With the rapid growth of the number of smart contracts, more and more data driven detection technologies based on machine learning have been proposed. However, some state‐of‐the‐art approaches mainly rely on the source code of smart contract. These methods are limited by the openness of the source code and the version of the programming language. To address this problem, we propose a novel vulnerability detection method based on transformer by constructing the control flow graph (CFG) of smart contracts operation codes (opcodes), which shields the difference of various versions of program language. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the authors' own collected dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 94.36\% accuracy in vulnerability detection, which performs better than other state‐of‐the‐art methods.A novel vulnerability detection method based on transformer is proposed by constructing the control flow graph (CFG) of smart contracts operation codes (opcodes), which shields the difference of various versions of program language.

abstract="Considering the fatality of malware attacks, the data-driven approach using massive malware observations has been verified. Deep learning-based approaches to learn the unified features by exploiting the local and sequential nature of control flow graph achieved the best performance. However, only considering local and sequential information from graph-based malware representation is not enough to model the semantics, such as structural and functional nature of malware. In this paper, functional nature are combined to the control flow graph by adding opcodes, and structural nature is embedded through DeepWalk algorithm. Subsequently, we propose the transformer-based malware control flow embedding to overcome the difficulty in modeling the long-term control flow and to selectively learn the code embeddings. Extensive experiments achieved performance improvement compared to the latest deep learning-based graph embedding methods, and in a 37.50{\%} improvement in recall was confirmed for the Simda botnet attack.",

We address these shortcomings with TaintDroid, an efficient, system-wide dynamic taint tracking and analysis system capable of simultaneously tracking multiple sources of sensitive data. TaintDroid enables realtime analysis by leveraging Android’s virtualized execution environment. TaintDroid incurs only 32\% performance overhead on a CPU-bound microbenchmark and imposes negligible overhead on interactive third-party applications. Using TaintDroid to monitor the behavior of 30 popular third-party Android applications, in our 2010 study we found 20 applications potentially misused users’ private information; so did a similar fraction of the tested applications in our 2012 study. Monitoring the flow of privacy-sensitive data with TaintDroid provides valuable input for smartphone users and security service firms seeking to identify misbehaving applications.},

abstract = {The large amounts of malware, and its diversity, have made it necessary for the security community to use automated dynamic analysis systems. These systems often rely on virtualization or emulation, and have recently started to be available to process mobile malware. Conversely, malware authors seek to detect such systems and evade analysis. In this paper, we present techniques for detecting Android runtime analysis systems. Our techniques are classified into four broad classes showing the ability to detect systems based on differences in behavior, performance, hardware and software components, and those resulting from analysis system design choices. We also evaluate our techniques against current publicly accessible systems, all of which are easily identified and can therefore be hindered by a motivated adversary. Our results show some fundamental limitations in the viability of dynamic mobile malware analysis platforms purely based on virtualization.},
