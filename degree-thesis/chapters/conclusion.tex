\section{Future Work}
There has been research into compressing and distilling Transformers 
(e.g., MobileBERT and TinyBERT) which could be applied so that a malware detector runs 
on device with minimal battery impact, though no specific publication has yet detailed a MobileBERT 
for malware, it is a logical direction for real-world use.

- use https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview and Deepseek for multi Agent system

- train The Encoder in the Codebased setting of Encoder-Only Model plus decision head

- Also look at execution Time, not just performance.
